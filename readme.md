# Evaluating Shrinkage Methods for Instrument Selection
The following repository houses all the code needed to replicate the results of the paper: "Evaluating Shrinkage Methods for Instrument Selection: A Simulation-Based Comparison" By Jasper Eppink, Micha Den Heijer, Peter Maarse and Misha Markovits.

## Install Virtual environment
Use the following steps to setup a virtual environment. We used Python 3.12 for our experiments.

For macOS:
1. python -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

For Windows:
1. python -m venv venv 
2. .\venv\Scripts\activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
